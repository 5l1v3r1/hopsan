<p>Plot curves are shown in plot windows. There are two methods to open a new plot window. The easist way is to right click on a port in the workspace and choose "Plot &lt;variable&gt;" from the menu. This will create a new plot window with the seleved plot variable. The more advanced way is to open the plot widget, by clicking on the plot icon in the simulation toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P. A list with all components in the current model will then appear. This list can be expanded so that it shows all ports in each component. From here a plot window can be created either by double clicking on a port name, or by dragging it to the workspace.</p>
<p>Because this list can be long and time consuming to search, it is possible to mark those variables that are especially interesting as <em>favorite</em> <em>variables</em>. This is done by right clicking on them and choosing this in the drop-down menu. Favorite parameters gets a yellow star in front of their names, and they always appear at the top in the widget to make them easily accessible.</p>
<p>Once a plot window has been opened, it is possible to add more plot curves to it by dragging items from the variable list to the window. New curves can be added either to the left y-axis, to the right y-axis or to the x-axis. The latter will replace the time vector and result in an XY-plot. Adding curves with different physical units to the same y-axis is generally not recommended, because they will use the same scale.</p>

<p>The plot window contains several useful tools. First of all it is possible to zoom or pan the graphs by using the two leftmost icons. Another way to change zoom factor is by using the scroll wheel on your mouse. To return to the original position, simply right click anywhere in the plot area. The third button is used to save plot windows, so that they can be opened at a later time. Plot windows are saved in the XML-based .hmpf (Hopsan Model Plot File) format. These can be opened from the plot widget by using the "Load Plot Window From XML" button. It is also possible to export plots graphically to .svg (Scaleable Vector Graphics) format, and to save and load plots by using the GNUPLOT format. The next set of tool buttons are used to modify the plot window cosmetically. It is possible to show or hide the grid, to change background color, to change line color and to change the width of the plot curves. The final set of buttons is used to control <em>plot</em> <em>generations</em>. If the same model are simulated several times, a new generation is added to the plot window as long as the "Auto Update" checkbox is checked. To move between different generations, press the left arrow or right arrow icons. A generation that is no longer of interest can be removed by clicking the red X button. </p>
