<h1>Building a model </h1>  </div>
</div>
<div class="contents">
<p>Models must be built according to the transmission line element method. You are adviced to read the section on this before you begin.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is create a new model, if you have not already done so. Click on File-&gt;New-&gt;Project, or press the New button in the toolbar. An empty model should now be visible in the workspace area.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="adding-components"></a>
Adding Components</h2>
<p>Next step is to add the components. To do this, you first need to find the components in the library. Standard components are divided into three libraries; hydraulic, mechanic and signal. These can in turn be filtered by different usages. When you have located the component you want, it can be added to your model by dragging it from the library to the workspace. The new component appear where you drop it, and can then be moved, rotated and flipped to a wanted position.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="connecting-components"></a>
Connecting Components</h2>
<p>Components in HOPSAN are connected by creating a <em>node</em> between two or more <em>ports</em>. In the graphical interface, a node is represented by a <em>connector</em>, represented by a line in the workspace. The color and style of the line tells of which type the node is. A black line represent bi-directional energy transmitting nodes (for example hydraulic or mechanic connections), while blue dotted lines reperesnt uni-directional signal connections. The connection is created by clicking on one of the ports, drawing the connector the way you want it and finally clikcing on the end port. Most ports, but not all, must be connected before simulating the model. Note that the TLM method results in that C-type components, such as volumes, can only be connected to Q-type components, such as valves or orifices. This can feel a little tricky, but is on the other hand always physically motivated. Signal components are simulated sequencially and do not obey these rules.

Changing Component Parameters</h2>
<p>To change parameteres of a component, you can double-click on it to open its parameter dialog box. Here it is possible to change the name of the component and its parameters. If the component is of C-type or signal type it is also possible to adjust the start values for its connected nodes. Errenous start values can potentially cause unwanted behaviour such as "jump steps" at the beginning of the plots.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="using-global-parameters"></a>
Using Global Parameters</h2>
<p>Global system parameters can be used to quickly change a parameter value in several components at once. To do this, open the <em>System</em> <em>Parameters</em> widget by clicking on the little earth globe icon in the toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Y. From here new system parameters can be added or removed by clicking on the "Set" and "Unset" buttons. Values can be changed directly by double-clicking on their values in the list. They can then be used as parameters in components by clicking on the icon to the right of the parameter value box in the component's parameter dialog. When a system parameter is changed, it will changed for all components that use it. Should a system parameter be removed, the components that use it will change to simply using the last numerical value of the parameter instead.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="subsystems"></a>
Subsystems</h2>
<p>Subsystems are not completely stable, and the use of them is discourage in the current release of Hopsan NG.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="widgets"></a>
Widgets</h2>
<p>To make models more nice looking and understandable, it is possible to add box widgets and text widgets. These are purely cosmetical and do not modify the behaviour of the system in any way. To add a widget, simply right click on the workspace and select "Add Text Widget" or "Add Box Widget" from the popup menu. A new widget will then appear at the menu position. Its appearance can then be modified by double clicking on it. Box widgets can also be resized by dragging the lines with the mouse. </p>
