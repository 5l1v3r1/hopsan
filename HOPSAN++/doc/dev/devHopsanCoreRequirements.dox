\page devHopsanCoreRequirements HopsanCore Dependence Libraries
HopsanCore depends on one external library for multi threaded simulations. Here is a description on how to build or install it.\n
If TBB is not found by qmake, then the core will be compiled without multi-threading support.

\section tbb TBB Intel Thread Building Blocks
\subsection tbb-ubuntu Build/Install TBB on Ubuntu
-# To make things easy, install from the package repository using, `sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev`

\subsection tbb-windows-mingw Build TBB on Windows using MinGW
-# Download the latest stable version 3 release source code, for example: "tbb30_20101215oss_src.tgz" from [https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download) stable release.
  -# For 32-bit builds unpack the contents to HopsanCore\\Dependencies\\tbb30_20101215oss (or whatever your version is)
  -# For 64-bit builds unpack the contents to HopsanCore\\Dependencies\\tbb30_20101215oss_64 (or whatever your version is)
-# Open a command prompt (Start->run->cmd). Navigate to the TBB directory that you just unpacked
-# Make sure that your desired compiler version is found in the beginning of your PATH variable, make sure you use the correct version (32 or 64 bit). It is **very important** that this is the same compiler as you will use to build Hopsan.
  -# Check your path variable with the command  `PATH`
  -# Set you PATH with the command  `set PATH=C:\path\to\your\mingw\bin;``%``PATH%`
  -# Check your path variable with the command  `PATH`
-# Run  `mingw32-make compiler=gcc tbb_build_prefix=output info` to see information before build, make sure *arch* is correct (32 or 64 bit)
  -# Run  `mingw32-make compiler=gcc tbb_build_prefix=output` to build both release and debug libraries
-# After a successful compilation you are done! You do not need to install or copy any files. The HopsanCore.pro file will automatically copy the needed binary files.
  -# **Note!** HopsanCore will have a set of default paths to search for, if you install a newer stable version of TBB you should add this version to the TOP of the defaults list in the HopsanCoreBuild.prf file.

\subsection tbb-windows-vcpp Build TBB on Windows using VC++ --Needs update after new project file structure--
These libs are already build with VC++ in the Windows specific download.
-# Download the latest stable release for windows, for example: "tbb30_20100406oss_win.zip"
-# Unzip it into "HopsanCore\\Dependencies". Check the lib and include path in the HopsanCore project file to make sure that the unpacked path is correct.
-# Add the appropriate tbb bin path (where the DLL is) to your build/run environment path, example: "C:\tbb\tbb30_20100406oss_win\tbb30_20100406oss\bin\ia32\vc9" for 32-bit VC9.0 compiler compatability.
