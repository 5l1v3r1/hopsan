\page devHopsanCoreRequirements HopsanCore Dependence Libraries
HopsanCore depends on one external library for multi threaded simulations. Here is a description on how to build or install it.\n
If TBB is not found by qmake, then the core will be compiled without multithreading support, this MAY, (but should not) crash HopsanGUI.

\section tbb TBB Intel Thread Building Blocks
\subsection tbb-ubuntu Build/Install TBB on Ubuntu
-# To make things easy, install from the package repository using, sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev

\subsection tbb-windows-mingw Build TBB on Windows using MinGW
-# Download the latest stable version 3 releses sorce code, for example: "tbb30_20101215oss_src.tgz" from "http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/download.php" stable release.
  -# Unpack the contents to HopsanCore\\Dependencies\\tbb30_20101215oss (or whatever your version is)
-# Open a Qt Command Prompt (you can find it in the start menu). Navigate to the tbb directory.
-# Run "mingw32-make compiler=gcc" to build both release and debug libraries
-# After a successful compilation you are done. You do not need to install or copy any files. The HopsanCore.pro file will automatically copy the needed binary files.
  -# \e Note! HopsanCore will have a set of default paths to search for, if you install a newer stable version of TBB you should add this version to the TOP of the defaults list in the HopsanCoreBuild.prf file.

\subsection tbb-windows-vcpp Build TBB on Windows using VC++ --Needs update after new project file structure--
These libs are already build with VC++ in the Windows specific download.
-# Download the latest stable releses for windows, for example: "tbb30_20100406oss_win.zip"
-# Unzip it into "HopsanCore\Dependencies". Check the lib and include path in the HopsanCore project file to make sure that the unpacked path is correct.
-# Add the apropriate tbb bin path (where the DLL is) to your build/run environment path, example: "C:\tbb\tbb30_20100406oss_win\tbb30_20100406oss\bin\ia32\vc9" for 32-bit VC9.0 compiler compatability.
