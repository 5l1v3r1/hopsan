    Important Information
******************************

- See the issue-tracker (link on web page) for all known issues.

- On WindowsXP fonts may look strange, ex: decimal point not visible. You need to activate ClearType font smoothing in Windows:
  Desktop->Properties->Appearance->Effects

- There is no guarantee that the default components are working under all conditions, you have decide for yourself if you trust the simulation results.
  From version 0.6.0, the source code for all default components are included in the release.

- There have been substantial "under the hood" changes between the 0.5.* and 0.6.* versions of hopsan.
  Loading old models in 0.6.0 should work without issues in most cases, HOWEVER, to be sure that you do not loose any information:
  * Deactivate "Group Similar Messages" in the message widget at the bottom before loading a model.
  * Pay attention to any Warnings or Errors you may receive when loading your old model. If parameters fail to load they will be discarded.
  * Parameters and ports may have changed name, in such cases you have to manually set the parameter value that could not be loaded (according to messages).
  
- Sometime when exporting a model as PNG or PDF some components "vanish" or become very small. We do not yet know why. If this is a problem take a screen shot instead.
