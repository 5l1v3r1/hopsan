Hopsan Release Notes


--Known issues--

- Some compatibility issues exist between version 0.3.0 and older versions, because some components were discarded. 
  These will not appear when loading the models. Some parameter names was also changed, these parameters will be reset.
- All components are not completely validated
- Align and rotate functions does not work for text widgets and box widgets
- In Windows Vista and Windows 7, it is strongly advisible to NOT save any files in the program installation directory. 
  Windows will actually save them in a completely different and hidden folder, so that the saved files will be very difficult to find.
