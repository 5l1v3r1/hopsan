COMPILING WITH SOURCE CODE:
1. Choose a C++ compatible compiler in Matlab with the "mex -setup" command (for example Visual Studio)
2. Compile HopsanSimulink.c by executing the first line only (!) HopsanSimulinkCompile.m in Matlab. This creates a file called HopsanSimulink.mexw32 (or similar, depending on operating system).
3. Launch Simulink and add a S-Function block. In the properties dialog, type "HopsanSimulink" in the "S-function name" field.
4. Hopefully everything is working by now!


COMPILING WITH PRECOMPILED LIBRARY (VISUAL STUDIO):
1. Compile HopsanCore with Visual C++. 
2. Move HopsanCore.dll, HopsanCore.lib and HopsanCore.exp to this folder.
3. Choose Visual Studio as the Matlab compiler with the mex -steup command.
2. Compile HopsanSimulink.c by executing the first line only (!) HopsanSimulinkCompile.m in Matlab. This creates a file called HopsanSimulink.mexw32 (or similar, depending on operating system).
3. Launch Simulink and add a S-Function block. In the properties dialog, type "HopsanSimulink" in the "S-function name" field.
4. Hopefully everything is working by now!


COMPILING WITH PRECOMPILED LIBRARY (MINGW):
Has not been done yet, but should be similar to Visual Studio. Getting Matlab to work with Mingw is however a complicated procedure.
