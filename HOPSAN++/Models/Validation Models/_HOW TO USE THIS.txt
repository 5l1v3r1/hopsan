All validation models in this folder will be verified before each new Hopsan release.

To create a new validation model:
1. Export plot data that is to be validated to csv file and put it here
2. Create a hvc (HopanValidationConfiguration) file according to the documentation. It will point to the model file and data file.
3. (Optional) You can also put the model file in this folder. In that case it is convenient if the files have the same filename (aside from extension)
4. Commit changes to svn!
