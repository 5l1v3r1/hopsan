//! @class InitializationThread
//! @brief The InitializationThread class implement a class to initialize a core model in a separate thread
//!
//! One reason to implement a initialization in a separate thread is to enable a progress bar.
//!


//! Constructor.
//! @param pComponentSystem is a pointer to the system to initialize.
//! @param startTime is the start time for the initialization.
//! @param finishTime is the finish time for the initialization.
//! @param parent is the parent of the thread, the a ProjectTabWidget
InitializationThread::InitializationThread(CoreSystemAccess *pGUIRootSystem, double startTime, double finishTime, ProjectTab *parent)
{
    mpParentProjectTab = parent;

    mpGUIRootSystem = pGUIRootSystem;

    mStartTime = startTime;
    mFinishTime = finishTime;

}


//! Implements the task for the thread.
void InitializationThread::run()
{
    mpGUIRootSystem->initialize(mStartTime, mFinishTime);

    //exec(); //Is used if one want to run an event loop in this thread.
