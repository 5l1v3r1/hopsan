\section requirements Requirements
HopsanGUI uses the Qt-libs for the GUI components, and qmake to generate makefiles.
You need to install the apropriate Qt-libs and the Qt-Creator IDE from <a href="http://qt.nokia.com" target="_blank">http://qt.nokia.com</a>

\subsection linux gcc in Linux
On Linux based operationg systems you should use the gcc compiler. Download and install the Qt SDK for Linux. You can use the Qt-libs in you distribution package repository and install Qt-Creator separately but if you want the latest Qt version you should use the SDK.

\subsection mingw MinGW (gcc in Windows)
If you want to use the MinGW open-source compiler you should donloaw the Qt SDK as it comes prepackaged with a patched MinGW suitable for Qt-libs. The libs them selfes are also compiled with MinGW. Make sure that you do not mix minGW versions. You need to use the version that comes with Qt as it is patched to work with Qt.
