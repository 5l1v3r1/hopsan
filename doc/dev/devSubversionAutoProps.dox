\page devSubversionAutoPropsPage Activating Auto-Props in you Subversion client configuration
If you are going to contribute code to the Hopsan subversion repository you should enable auto-props.
This means that if you add new files some necessary file properties for those files will automatically be added. Without auto-props you would need to remember to add them manually on every new file (which you will likely forget most of the time).
