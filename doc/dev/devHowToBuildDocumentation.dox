\page devHowtoBuildDocumentationPage How to Build the Documentation
The Hopsan Documentation is based on Doxygen. You are only required to install Doxygen, the other tools are optional.\n
Graphviz and dvipng (with latex) are used to show pretty dependence graphs and latex equations in the documentation.\n
If you want to build a pdf manual than latex must be installed (and pdf activated in the Doxyfile)

\section devDoxygenInstallUbuntu Install and build the documentation in Ubuntu
-# Install the necessary packages with: "apt-get install doxygen graphviz dvipng"\n

To build or later rebuild the documentation, run "buildDocumentation.sh" with argument \b user or \b dev or no argument to build both versions.\n
Open doc/dev/html/index.html or doc/user/html/index.html in a web browser after building.

\section devDoxygenInstallWindows Install and build the documentation in Windows

-# The latest version of Doxygen can be downloaded here: 
   <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc" target="_blank">http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc</a>\n
-# The latest stable version of graphviz (for cool graphs) can be downloaded here: 
   <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php" target="_blank">http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php</a>\n
-# A LaTeX package including dvipng (to generate png for latex equations), 
   We recomend: <a href="http://miktex.org/" target="_blank">http://miktex.org/</a>
-# You will also need Ghostscript \b 9.05 \b win32 for formulas, install to default directory. c:/"ProgramFiles (or similar)"/gs/gs9.05\n
   You must use 9.05 because paths are hard coded in buildDocumentation scripts, (you can set your global path as an alternative if you like some other version).
   You can find it here <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/</a>

To build or later rebuild the documentation, double click the buildDevDocumentation.bat or buildUserDocumentation.bat file.\n
Open doc/dev/html/index.html or doc/user/html/index.html in a web browser after building.
