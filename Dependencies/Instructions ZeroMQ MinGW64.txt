To build zeromq on Windows using MinGW-W64 follow these instructions.
You will need to build under MSYS (a unix tools environment that you can run in Windows)
See http://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/wiki2/MSYS/ for more details

--Unpacking--
1. Unpack MSYS-20111123.zip
2. Unpack zeromq4.1.0.zip (or newer)
3. Add "_64" to teh end of the zeromq directory name

--Find mingw inside MSYS--
1. Run msys/msys.bat
2. Mount your MinGW compiler directory (/mingw is in MSYS path automatically)
   "mount c:/Qt/qt-5.3.2-x64-mingw491r1-seh/mingw64 /mingw" (or similar command)

--Configure and build zeromq--
1. Navigate to the zeromq directory
   "cd /c/svn/hopsan/trunk/ThirdParty/zeromq-4.1.0_64"  (or similar command)
2. "./configure --prefix=/mingw --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32"
3. Compile using 4 threads
   "make -j4"

Now you are done! 
Write "exit" to quit MSYS

-- C++ headers --
You need zeromq c++ headers as well. No build required (header only inclusion)
1. unpack "cppzmq-master.zip"  (or similar file)


-- Message Pack --
You need message pack for serialization/de-serialization. No build required (header only inclusion)
1. unpack "msgpack-c-master.zip" (or similar file)

-- Runtime issues --
You need to copy the "libstdc++-6.dll" and "libgcc_s_seh-1.dll" files from the compiler bin directory into your Hopsan runtime directory to be able to run.

You may get an assert error in zeromq.hpp after the line "rc = zmq_ctx_set (ptr, ZMQ_MAX_SOCKETS, max_sockets_);"
For now just comment the assert check after (need to fix this somehow)
